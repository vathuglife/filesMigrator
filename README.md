# Welcome to Files Migrator!
This is a desktop application that can gather all files from different destinations, 
as well as organize them into specific folders for easier access. The project also 
allows me to understand how a GUI app works on the Desktop environment, getting used to 
the Python syntax, as well as Object-Oriented Concepts. 

Since this is one of my very first projects, the folder
organization as well as file separation might be so horrendous 
that it could easily disturb viewers. 
So please be careful!
