# Welcome to Files Migrator!

## Introduction
This is a desktop application that can gather all files from different destinations, 
as well as organize them into specific folders for easier access. The project also 
allows me to understand how a GUI app works on the Desktop environment, getting used to 
the Python syntax, as well as some Object-Oriented Concepts. 

Since this is one of my very first projects, the folder
organization as well as file separation might be so horrendous 
that it could easily disturb viewers. 
So please be careful!

## Technologies used
Just Kivy (a Python framework).

## Motivation
The idea of this application stemmed from the hassle of searching for a specific file with a specific format (e.g. abc.zip) in a folder containing different formats (e.g. .zip, .img, .exe...). We can eliminate this problem by building an application that filters out files by their format, then organize them into respective folders (e.g. .zip files into Zip folder...)
